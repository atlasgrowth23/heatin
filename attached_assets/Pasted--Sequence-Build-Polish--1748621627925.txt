| **1. Customers tab**                       | *Add / edit customer, address, phone, membership toggle.* Show past jobs when a customer record opens.                                                                                                                                | You can’t create real jobs until there are customers to attach them to.    |
| **2. Job-Creation modal + Jobs board**     | *“New Job” → choose customer → date/time → pick tasks from Pricebook.* Merge your old Scheduling + Service Calls into one **Jobs** list with status chips (Unassigned · Scheduled · In-Progress · Done) and a day/week calendar view. | This is the daily workspace for both solo techs and 6-truck dispatchers.   |
| **3. Line-item picker wired to Pricebook** | In the Job modal, searchable list that pulls **Task Name, Std Price, Est Hours**. Auto-fill membership or after-hours price when rules match.                                                                                         | Proves the pricebook import really lives throughout the app.               |

| **6. Dashboard cards**                     | Auto-populate “Jobs Today”, “Open Invoices \$”, and “Avg Ticket”. Keep it minimal.                                                                                                                                                    | Gives owners instant feedback the first day they log real work.            |
