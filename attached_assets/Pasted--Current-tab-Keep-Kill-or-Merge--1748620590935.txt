| **Dashboard**                      | **Keep** but postpone polish. It’s meaningless until data exists. | *Dashboard* – leave as thin “Metrics” card until invoices start flowing.                                            |
| **Customers**                      | **Keep**                                                          | Same name – contractors already use the term.                                                                       |

| **Invoicing**                      | **Keep**                                                          | **Invoices & Payments** – add “Send Pay Link” ability later.                                                        |

| **Reports**                        | **Stub** (hide from solo accounts)                                | Show once there’s >3 techs or >30 invoices so charts aren’t empty.                                                  |
